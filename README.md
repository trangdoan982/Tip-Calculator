Submitted by: **Trang Doan**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] You can slide the "Split between" to decide how many people are you splitting the bill with. After you done sliding, the amount for each person will appear in the final row.

## Notes
- [ ] To implement the split bill function, I need to strengthen my knowledge about IBActions and did various test
- [ ] I tried to implement the settings page but couldn't since the push segue is depricated after iOS 8. I believe there should be an alternative for it but couldn't find one. 
- [ ] Relate to the second point, definitely need to improve my Googling skill.
